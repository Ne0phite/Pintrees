# Pinterest_clone

# Minimum Viable Product

Pinterest is a popular web-app to lookup and organize images and url links. These links are called "pins". Similar pins are organized on one a "board". I will build Pinterest_clone using Javascript and React/Redux on the front-end and Express and MySQL on the backend.
By the end of the production period, this app will, at a minimum, satisfy the following criteria:

- Hosting on a live server
- New user account creation, login and deleting.
- Browsing and searching for pins and users``` by pins titles and usernames, respectively.
- Creating new pins and boards.
- Saving pins
- Deleting pins/boards.
